## My name is [Tyler May](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tyler-may-0a73a81b/) and I have a passion for data analytics and a love of coffee.

Most of my life, I refused to drink coffee.  I thought it was bitter, disgusting and it turned your teeth yellow.  A few years ago, my girlfriend (now wife!) said "Sometimes I just want to relax and drink coffee with you", so I attempted to drink coffee.  I started off with the sugary and sweet drinks from Starbucks which my favorite was always a mocha.  From there, we found a local coffee shop ([Big Dog]()) that we enjoyed.  I quickly noticed the mocha that I bought there was much much better than my mocha at Starbucks.  At the time (I know this makes me sound dumb) but I thought Espresso Beans were different from Coffee Beans.

## The goal of this blog is to create data visualizations and posts about my experiences with coffee and my quest to brewing the "perfect cup"!
